# Timestamp API

An Express.js API that converts a given calendar date to its affiliated timestamp and vice versa.

Inspired by the [Timestamp Microservice challenge](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/timestamp-microservice) as part of the curriculum for the [Back End Development and APIs Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis) on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

# Timestamp API

An Express.js API that converts a given calendar date to its affiliated timestamp and vice versa.

Inspired by the [Timestamp Microservice challenge](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/timestamp-microservice) as part of the curriculum for the [APIs and Microservices Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices) on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).
